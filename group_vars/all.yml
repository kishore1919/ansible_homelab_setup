# Global variables that apply to all hosts in the inventory
# These variables are used across all roles and playbooks

# The path to a YAML file containing VM definitions, potentially from a Puppet/Hiera setup.
# This is used by the 'kvm_setup' role to load VM data if 'cncloud::custom::vm_data' is not defined elsewhere.
# Default path assumes a Puppet/Hiera directory structure, but can be overridden.
custom_underlay_path: /etc/puppet/hiera/data/role/custom/custom-underlay.yaml

# Additional global variables can be added here:
# - System-wide configuration settings
# - Default paths and directories
# - Common credentials (use Ansible Vault for sensitive data)
# - Network configuration parameters
